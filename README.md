# React Disco Client

## About the Project
React Disco Client is a web-based application to control *Discographer, the Automated Disk-Jockey* created by John Howard. It uses ReactJS, Semantic UI React, SASS, Babel, and Webpack.

This project requires a proprietary server and RESTful API in order to function. Unfortunately, these components are currently available to publish on Github.
