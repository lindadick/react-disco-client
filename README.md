# React Disco Client

## About the Project
React Disco Client is a web-based application to control *Discographer, the Automated Disk-Jockey* created by John Howard. It uses React, Semantic UI React, SASS, Babel, and Webpack.

This project requires a proprietary server and REST API in order to function. Unfortunately, these components are currently unavailable to publish on Github.
